## Project Name

Kanban Task Management System

## Setup Instruction

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Architecture Overview

- Component Based
- URL state management
- Local Storage for Data

## Key Decisions and Tradeoffs

- Due to the limited time, I focused on implementing all the requested features successfully. Some performance optimizations could be further improved, but I prioritized delivering a complete and functional solution

## Testing Approach

- Lighthouse

## Time Spent

7 hours

## If I had more time:

- I would break the app into smaller, more modular components for better reusability. Some components could be server components for static data, while highly interactive ones would be client components.
- I would focus more on performance optimizations.
- I would create generalized styles, using variables for colors, spacing, and typography, to make theming and future updates easier.
- I would improve the overall project structure, organizing files and components in a more maintainable way.
